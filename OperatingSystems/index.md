# Operating systems

In this part, you will learn about operating systems. Maybe you don't know at all what an operating system is so let's begin with a little definition.

> An operating system (OS) is a software that manages computer's hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer's programs. (Source: Wikipedia.org)

Now, there is, of course, a lot of different OS so we're just gonna talk about the mostly used:
* [Windows](#windows)
* [macOS](#macos)
* [Linux](#linux)

And because your smartphone is also a computer, we're also gonna talk about the two main mobile OS:

* [iOS](#ios)
* [Android](#android)

## Windows

Let's begin with, i think, the mostly used OS: Windows. We compare it to a big chocolate cake that would make you drool over it instantly upon seeing it. Only to be completely full after a few bites and make you question your life choices altogether.

#### "Why is Windows still the most widely used OS if it is so disgusting?"

There is one main reason: Windows is pre-installed on most computers that you can buy in trade. But let's be kind, Windows isn't so bad after all. It remains a good OS for people who don't want to know what's going on under the hood (most people really don't care) and its newest versions managed to fill the gap with other OSes feature-wise.

## macOS

Moving on to an other OS used by many people: macOS. We see this OS like a rainbow cake as it is fancy and shinny. The fact is that it is actually a great OS for every kind of users and this because it is really simple to use and you can do almost anything you want with it. This OS is mostly used by artists because Apple provides a lot of programs useful for creative work.

#### "Quality-wise, aren't macs more expensive than they should?"

Of course the answer is yes, and not because you're paying a big part of the price just to have a bitten apple on your computer. My main argument is: it isn't worth it. You can have similar performances for a much lower price. But again, macOS is a great OS, if you want to create artistic content like music or just want to have a beautiful interface and can afford it, go ahead you won't be disapointed.

## Linux

Linux (or GNU/Linux) is not an OS by itself but rather a line of OS, indeed there is a lot of projects called, _distributions_, which refer to it. Getting onto a Linux computer is liking going on with a recipe which has blanks and a small parts of the ingredients. You have to do almost everything yourself!

#### "Why use Linux OS if they are so complicated?"

First of all they are not as complicated as they seem to be, Linux distributions are most of the time _user-friendly_ and allow you to do basic stuff just with your mouse through a graphic interface.
They seem to be complicated because they are mainly used by programmers and other IT professionnals and the kind of work they do needs to be done through a _command line interface_. The reason why you should use Linux computers is that it gives you absolute control over your system.

### Family relationship between Linux and macOS

Even if they seem to be different, Linux and macOS are made out of the same wood! Indeed, they are both based on the same core: UNIX. UNIX now defines a family of OS following the same rules.
