# Operating systems

In this part, you'll learn about operating systems. Maybe you don't know at all what is an operating system so let's begin with a little definition.

Now, there is, of course, a lot of different OS so we're just gonna talk about the mostly used:
* [Windows](#windows)
* [macOS](#macos)
* [Linux](#linux)

And because your smartphone is also a computer, we're also gonna talk about the two main mobile OS:

* [iOS](#ios)
* [Android](#android)

## Windows

Let's begin with, i think, the mostly used OS: Windows. We can compare this line of OS with a big chocolate cake, you know this big chocolate that makes you hungry when you see it. But after a few bites you're going totally disgusted.

#### "Why is Windows still the most widely used OS if it is so disgusting?"

There is one main reason: Windows is pre-installed in the most part of computers that you can buy in trade. But let's be kind, Windows isn't so bad after all. It remains a good OS for people who don't want to know what's going on in their computer (the most part of people) and with its newest versions it fills the gap between its features and the others OS ones.
