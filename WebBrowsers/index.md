In this part, you'll learn about web browsers. We guess that most of you know what is a social network but here's a explanation from a very know and serious web encyclopedia.

> A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web.
> An information resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI/URL) that may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content.
> Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their browsers to related resources. (Source: Wikipedia)
